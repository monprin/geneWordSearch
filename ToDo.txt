This a list of future potential enhancements, presence on this list does not ensure eventual implementation nor is there a guarantee of time frame. Potential additions are welcome.

1.  import modules so they are available in the namespace and can be used
       when other modules in the namespace. e.g.
       > import geneWordSearch as gws
       > x = gws.geneWordSeach(['gene1','gene2','gene3'],'arabidopsis')
       #from genewordsearch import *
2.  Put example searches on the websites
3.  Implement REST protocols
4.  Implement a translation matrix for homologous genes to better leverage interspecies data
5.  Look into Dirchlet analysis
